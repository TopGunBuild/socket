## Client Setting up

To install this module:

```bash
npm install topgun-socket
```

## How to use client module

The socket-client script is called `client.js`(ESM) or `client.global.js`(iife) (located in the dist directory).
Embed it in your HTML page like this:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/topgun-socket@latest/dist/client.global.js"></script>
```

\* Note that the src attribute may be different depending on how you setup your HTTP server.

Once you have embedded the client `client.global.js` into your page, you will gain access to a global `TopGunSocket` object.
You may also use CommonJS `require` or ES6 module imports.

### Connect to a server

```js
let socket = TopGunSocket.create({
    hostname: "localhost",
    port: 8000,
});
```

### Transmit data

```js
// Transmit some data to the server.
// It does not expect a response from the server.
// From the server socket, it can be handled using either:
// - for await (let data of socket.receiver('foo')) {}
// - let data = await socket.receiver('foo').once()
socket.transmit('foo', 123);
```

### Invoke an RPC

```js
(async () => {

  // Invoke an RPC on the server.
  // It expects a response from the server.
  // From the server socket, it can be handled using either:
  // - for await (let req of socket.procedure('myProc')) {}
  // - let req = await socket.procedure('myProc').once()
  let result = await socket.invoke('myProc', 123);

})();
```

### Subscribe to a channel

```js
(async () => {

  // Subscribe to a channel.
  let myChannel = socket.subscribe('myChannel');

  await myChannel.listener('subscribe').once();
  // myChannel.state is now 'subscribed'.

})();
```

### Get a channel without subscribing

```js
(async () => {

  let myChannel = socket.channel('myChannel');

  // Can subscribe to the channel later as a separate step.
  myChannel.subscribe();
  await myChannel.listener('subscribe').once();
  // myChannel.state is now 'subscribed'.

})();
```

### Publish data to a channel

```js
// Publish data to the channel.
myChannel.publish('This is a message');

// Publish data to the channel from the socket.
socket.publish('myChannel', 'This is a message');
```

### Consume data from a channel

```js
(async () => {

  for await (let data of myChannel) {
    // ...
  }

})();
```

### Connect over HTTPS:

```js
let options = {
  hostname: 'securedomain.com',
  secure: true,
  port: 443,
  rejectUnauthorized: false // Only necessary during debug if using a self-signed certificate
};
// Initiate the connection to the server
let socket = TopGunSocket.create(options);
```

### Connect Options

```js
let options = {
  path: '/topgunsocket/',
  port: 8000,
  hostname: '127.0.0.1',
  autoConnect: true,
  secure: false,
  rejectUnauthorized: false,
  connectTimeout: 10000, //milliseconds
  ackTimeout: 10000, //milliseconds
  channelPrefix: null,
  disconnectOnUnload: true,
  multiplex: true,
  autoReconnectOptions: {
    initialDelay: 10000, //milliseconds
    randomness: 10000, //milliseconds
    multiplier: 1.5, //decimal
    maxDelay: 60000 //milliseconds
  },
  authEngine: null,
  codecEngine: null,
  subscriptionRetryOptions: {},
  query: {
    yourparam: 'hello'
  }
};
```

## How to use server module

You need to attach it to an existing Node.js http or https server (example):
```js
const http = require('http');
const topGunSocketServer = require("topgun-socket/server");

let httpServer = http.createServer();
let agServer = topGunSocketServer.attach(httpServer);

(async () => {
  // Handle new inbound sockets.
  for await (let {socket} of agServer.listener('connection')) {

    (async () => {
      // Set up a loop to handle and respond to RPCs for a procedure.
      for await (let req of socket.procedure('customProc')) {
        if (req.data.bad) {
          let error = new Error('Server failed to execute the procedure');
          error.name = 'BadCustomError';
          req.error(error);
        } else {
          req.end('Success');
        }
      }
    })();

    (async () => {
      // Set up a loop to handle remote transmitted events.
      for await (let data of socket.receiver('customRemoteEvent')) {
        // ...
      }
    })();

  }
})();

httpServer.listen(8000);
```

## Running the tests

-   Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:TopGunBuild/topgun-socket.git`
-   Navigate to project directory: `cd topgun-socket`
-   Install all dependencies: `npm install`
-   Run the tests: `npm test`

## Benefits of async `Iterable` over `EventEmitter`

-   **More readable**: Code is written sequentially from top to bottom. It avoids event handler callback hell. It's also much easier to write and read complex integration test scenarios.
-   **More succinct**: Event streams can be easily chained, filtered and combined using a declarative syntax (e.g. using async generators).
-   **More manageable**: No need to remember to unbind listeners with `removeListener(...)`; just `break` out of the `for-await-of` loop to stop consuming. This also encourages a more declarative style of coding which reduces the likelihood of memory leaks and unintended side effects.
-   **Less error-prone**: Each event/RPC/message can be processed sequentially in the same order that they were sent without missing any data; even if asynchronous calls are made inside middleware or listeners. On the other hand, with `EventEmitter`, the listener function for the same event cannot be prevented from running multiple times in parallel; also, asynchronous calls within middleware and listeners can affect the final order of actions; all this can cause unintended side effects.

## Reference

The code in this repository is based on `socketcluster-server` (https://github.com/SocketCluster/socketcluster-server) and `socketcluster-client` (https://github.com/SocketCluster/socketcluster-client). The code is written in typescript and is ready to run in a serverless environment.
